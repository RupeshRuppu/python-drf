DRF - Django Rest Framework

Api -> application programming interface.
   - it acts as a two way communication bridge between BE & FE.

Rest Api -> Representational state transfer.
   - stateless ( the server doesn't store any information about the client between requests );
   - client server architecture;
   - REST apis rely on set of standard http methods ( get, post, put, delete, patch );


Web application endpoints
   - user can directly access it from web browsers
API endpoints
   - returns the data to integrate into the frontend
   

DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": getenv("DB_NAME"),
        "USER": getenv("DB_USER"),
        "PASSWORD": getenv("DB_PASSWORD"),
        "HOST": getenv("DB_HOST"),
        "PORT": getenv("DB_PORT"),
    }
}

Serialization & De-Serialization
- modal instances to json/xml form.
- json to modal instances back is de-serialization

- function based views
- class based views (more structured & organized way to handle requests using OOPS)
- mixins
- generics
   - just like mixins provides pre-built mixins classes generics also provides pre-built VIEW classes


- viewsets
- routers

- viewsets.ModelViewSets

- nested serializers
   - imagine you have a blog application.
   - 1 post can have multiple comments
   - we usually create a foreign key relation ship between post & comments
   - let's say you want to fetch a blog with all it's comments that's where the nested serializers comes in.
